A very old website developed with Wordpress for [Mazzucchellis](http:www.mazzucchellis.com)
who sell costumes, accessories and decorations for parties, Carnival and Halloween!

I know, Wordpress is ugly, my code is ugly...but sometimes I implement some new theme's feature for the Gran'Ol' Mazzucchellis,
so don't blame me dude!
